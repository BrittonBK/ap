# Hello, world!

Welcome to Ruston High's implementation of the AP course "Computer Science Principles"!! This is an AP course, so please be prepared to spend some time outside of class working on homework, projects, and/or studying. The amount of time required will vary greatly from person to person and from unit to unit within the course. 

In a similar fashion to a math course, a good rule of thumb is "Don't Get Behind!" If there are concepts you are not understanding or ideas you need more practice with, don't wait!! Watch all of the videos for each section. Go back and redo past problems. Find tutorials on the interwebs. Get help from your teacher and classmates with the concepts. Just don't delay!

# CS50?

The curriculum we follow is CS50. This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.
